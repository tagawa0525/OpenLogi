//! Live control capture for one device: divert the device's gesture sources
//! (the MX dedicated gesture button and/or the MX Master 4 haptic panel), the
//! DPI/ModeShift button, and the thumb wheel over HID++ and turn their events
//! into [`CapturedInput`] the GUI can dispatch.
//!
//! [`run_capture_session`] holds a single HID++ channel open for one device,
//! enables diversion on whichever of those controls it exposes, registers one
//! message listener, and restores every control's default mapping on shutdown.
//! Using one channel matters: a second channel to the same device would split
//! its input-report stream, so all captured controls share this session.
//!
//! The session is transport-only — it has no opinion on what an input *does*.
//! The GUI maps each [`CapturedInput`] to the user's bound action and dispatches
//! it, mirroring how the CGEventTap hook handles the side buttons. The thumb
//! wheel is special: diverting it stops native horizontal scroll, so the GUI
//! re-synthesises scroll from the [`CapturedInput::Scroll`] deltas — the wheel
//! is therefore only diverted when the user's thumbwheel config leaves its
//! defaults (click bound, rotation rebound, or sensitivity changed).
