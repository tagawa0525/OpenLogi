//! HID inventory watcher: periodic polling, woken early by hotplug events.
//!
//! Spawns a dedicated OS thread with a one-shot tokio runtime that calls
//! `openlogi_hid::enumerate` every `period` and forwards each completed
//! snapshot over an unbounded mpsc to the agent's select loop, which applies
//! it via `Orchestrator::refresh_inventory`.
//!
//! An OS hotplug event (`openlogi_hid::watch_hotplug`) cuts the wait short so
//! a just-plugged device is probed — and gets its persisted settings applied —
//! within a settle delay instead of a full period. The periodic tick stays as
//! the reconciliation pass (battery refresh, missed events, platforms where
//! the hotplug stream is unavailable).
